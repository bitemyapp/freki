Freki TODO list
#+STARTUP: content

* Freki waypoint List [0/9]
** Board [0/1]
*** Basic board "point cloud" intersection implementation
    I suspect that the structure of this system is going to be based
    on linear intersections between expression defined functions. If a
    region R is completely bounded by some set of edges E, then the
    line L can _only_ pass through the region R if L intersects with
    at least one edge \in E. Use Expresso to solve for the
    intersection point(s).

*** Working game board representation
    - (place     [board model x y])
    - (move-manh [board model dx dy])
    - (move-vec  [board model theta d])

*** TODO GUI board visualization
**** TODO Be able to show a "grid" breakdown
**** TODO Be able to draw the outer tangent lines
**** TODO Be able to draw a rotated sprite
     
** LoS [0/3]
*** TODO Working line of sight between models
    The line of sight between two models needs to be computed first as
    zone bounded by the outer tangent line between the two models in
    question. The LoS base size heuristic then applies to models
    within this chanel from A to B.
    
*** TODO Working line of sight between models with terrain and clouds
    Really this comes down to finding some representation for terain
    and coulds which reduces to base size or polygonal base area as a
    point cloud. This'll be easy for rectangular terain and for cloud
    effects, but for nonregular terain it's gonna be a real pain.

** Movement [0/4]
*** TODO State update for checked model movement
*** TODO Model movement animation
*** TODO Model movement with terrain effects
*** TODO Model movement with animated speed
    
** Viz [0/3]
*** TODO Movement profile visualization
    - Be able to draw the movement circle as an underlay
*** TODO Charge profile visualization
    - Be able to draw the charge circle as an underlay
*** TODO Shooting profile visualization
    - Be able to draw different ranges as an underlay

** AI [0/6]
*** TODO Be able to do attack scheduling
*** TODO Build on attack scheduling to do target assignment
*** TODO Build on target assignment to restrict domain with threat radius
*** TODO Build charge lane identification
*** TODO Build shooting lane identification
*** TODO Try to build a movement heuristic based on blocking charge & firing lanes when attacks are not in order
