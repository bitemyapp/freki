# Freki

Named for Odin's hunting hound, Freki is the framework around which I
hope to evolve an AI capable of playing a full game of Warmachine. At
present, it is simply a collection of machine representations for
various aspects of the game which I am (very) slowly assembling.

## Goals
Freki is an AI suite. As such, Freki does not seek to allow humans to
play each other. Freki seeks only to make computational analysis of
Warmachine play and AI vs AI play with full rules possible. There will
be no game with even halfway reasonable graphics here. For that look
to Vassal or to Warmachine Tactics.

That said, there are some project goals

### Near Term
     - Datafile structure and loading [25% designed, 0% implemented]
     - Model position/movement AI     [10% designed, 0% implemented]
     - Target selection AI            [90% designed, 0% implemented]
     - Effect simulation              [50% designed, 0% implemented]
     - Stat check simulation          [70% designed, 0% implemented]
     - Rule specification language    [0% designed, 0% implemented]

### Long term
 - Strategy/tendancy tuning
 - Winning a game/tourney

### Uber Long Term
 - Vision based board analysis & model position computation
 - Programatic list analysis based on statistical model usage
 - List based strategy analysis
 - Automated list generation based on synergy analysis

## Documentation
There is a whole lot of writeup about the mechanics of Freki
